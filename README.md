WebVR experimenting
I am trying to break down the walled garden VR. The plan is to create an in-browser browser for virtual reality experiences without the need for plugins.

Instead of having to jump in and out of experiments I will attempt to create virtual reality links in the form of portals.
Walking to a different room (or site) being as easy as walking through a doorway like you would in real life.

This all together with others.

Blend WebGL, WebRTC (data channels) and VR, and you get this.
